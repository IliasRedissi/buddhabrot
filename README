A very small but complete implementation of the Buddhabrot style rendering
of Mandelbrot fractals. From wikipedia:

"The Buddhabrot is a map related to the Mandelbrot set. Its name reflects
its similarity to classical depictions of Gautama Buddha, seated in a
meditation pose with a forehead mark (tikka) and traditional topknot
(ushnisha).

(...)

...a random sampling of c points are iterated through the Mandelbrot function.
For points which do escape within a chosen maximum number of iterations, and
therefore are not in the Mandelbrot set, their values are sent through the
Mandelbrot function again and this time its path is plotted into the array.
After a large number of c values have been iterated, grayscale shades are then
chosen based on the values recorded in the array."

Currently implemented in gtk+ 2.0, so it should be completelly cross platform.
Just compile it with default parameters and include gtk libs. In general:

cc -std=c99 -o buddhabrot buddhabrot.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0`

The program will spend some time generating the image, then show the
final result.

Play with the variables:
	- R: number of random samples (random samples are tested to check if they
	                               will be used for drawing the fractal, more
	                               samples, more plots)
	- M and m: minimum and maximum iterations (only samples that create a path
	                               betweeen these lengths "inside" the fractal
	                               are drawn)
